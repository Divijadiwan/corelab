Data that I downloaded - **Spotify Data**

I analysed my Spotify Data and realised how each song I listen to depicts an **emotion** I felt or wanted to feel at that moment. 
So for my project I wanted people to experience these different emotions and was thinking of different ways to execute my project. I still haven't decided on anything but some ideas I have are:
-  A website - Essentially where people can tap into different moods and listen to music accordingly 
-  A 3D experience - Where people experience each mood

I realised that listening to music is a **web experience** so I stuck to creating a website. I analysed my songs and found 5 moods that I had - Fun/Energetic, Romantic/Emotional, Calm, Spiritual and Confident/Uplifting. And then I used code to see how many plays I had for each song and took my top 3 songs for each of these moods. 
Through this project users can deep delve into each of these emotions and listen to the music from the moods.
