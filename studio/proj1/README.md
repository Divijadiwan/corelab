Data that I downloaded - **Spotify Data**

I analysed my Spotify Data and realised how each song I listen to depicts an **emotion** I felt or wanted to feel at that moment. 
So for my project I wanted people to experience these different emotions and was thinking of different ways to execute my project. I still haven't decided on anything but some ideas I have are:
-  A website - Essentially where people can tap into different moods and listen to music accordingly 
-  A 3D experience - Where people experience each mood

***will add more information as I even know***
